## ðŸ§­ Image Alignment Notebook

This notebook (`Image_alignment.ipynb`) demonstrates how to align two images using feature detection and matching, followed by homography computation.

### Key Features
- ORB feature detection and matching
- Homography estimation using RANSAC
- Visualization of aligned images

### Requirements
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

### Use Cases
- Panorama creation
- Image stitching
- Object tracking and recognition
